# The Eclipse Embedded CDT web site

This is the GitHub Pages project intended to store the
public HTML version of the **Eclipse Embedded CDT web site**.

The actual content, generated by Jekyll, is in the `docs` folder.

**DO NOT** send pull requests to this project, use the 
[web-jekyll](https://github.com/eclipse-embed-cdt/web-jekyll),
where the site source is located.

The web site URL is:

- https://eclipse-embed-cdt.github.io/

The GitHub project used to store it is:

- https://github.com/eclipse-embed-cdt.github.io/

This site superseeds the [GNU MCU Eclipse](https://gnu-mcu-eclipse.github.io),
site, which is now deprecated.

The content migration will take a while, so the current status is
_work in progress_.
